RIFS – Robotic Interactive Feedback System

📌 Disclaimer

This is a legacy project created in 2022/23 during my university studies. The code in this repository may not reflect best practices, but I believe it's important to showcase my progress. Since then, I have focused on writing cleaner, more maintainable code, drawing from principles outlined in Clean Code by Robert C. Martin.

🎛 Project Overview

RIFS (Robotic Interactive Feedback System) is a project exploring sonic automata and musical robotics. It features:

    A robotic catapult arm system controlled by a Teensy microcontroller using Arduino IDE.
    Max/MSP software for real-time sound processing.
    An array of speakers and microphones, enabling dynamic interaction through feedback loops.

🎯 Project Goals

The project aimed to investigate:

    How robotic systems can extend musical creativity beyond traditional human musicianship.
    The interplay between mechanics, sound processing, and generative music.

⚡ Future Reflection

While this project was a key step in my journey, my approach to software development has evolved significantly. I now prioritise:
✅ Clean, modular, and maintainable code.
✅ Scalable architectures.
✅ Best practices in software engineering.
